# Number_Guessing_Game

This terminal game does the following:
1. Ask the user to enter a number that will set the range of their guessing.
2. Set the random number.
3. As the user enters a guess, the game will tell them if their guess was too high or too low.
4. If they guess the correct number, tell them they "Hit!" and then end the application.
